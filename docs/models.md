# Models

## Overview
Serialized machine learning models and pipelines.

## Files
- `best_model.pkl`: trained model artifact, explain what algorithm it is.
- `best_pipeline.pkl`: full pipeline (preprocessing + model).

## Notes
- How to regenerate these files (point to script).
- Versioning strategy (if you retrain often).
- File size/storage considerations (Git LFS, releases).
