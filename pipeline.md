Here’s a structured breakdown you can use to document **every conceptual topic** in your `model_pipeline.py`, together with why and how each output is chosen and what it means. You can copy this into your project’s README or a separate design doc.

---

## 📂 1. Data Loading & Preparation

### Code

```python
repo_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), os.pardir))
data_path = os.path.join(repo_root, 'data', 'processed', 'players_clean.csv')
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
```

### What it does

* **Finds your project root** dynamically, so the script works no matter where it’s executed from.
* **Loads** the cleaned CSV into a DataFrame, which ensures all downstream steps have the sanitized, uniform data you produced earlier.

### Why we look for it

* You need a reliable way to access the **same cleaned data** each run.
* Documenting this shows how to reproduce the pipeline.

---

## 🔧 2. Target Definition & Transformation

### Code

```python
X     = df.drop('price', axis=1)
y_log = np.log1p(df['price'])
```

### What it does

* **Splits** features (`X`) from the target (`price`).
* **Applies** a log(+1) transform to the target (`y_log`) to stabilize variance (common when targets are skewed).

### Why we look for it

* **Log-transformation** often reduces the impact of extreme values (“€100 M” vs. “€1 M”) and improves linear-model performance.
* Documenting it explains why your models train on `y_log` instead of raw `price`.

---

## 🔄 3. Preprocessing Definition & Fitting

### Code

```python
full_pre = ColumnTransformer([...])
full_pre.fit(X)
wrapped_pre = FunctionTransformer(full_pre.transform, validate=False)
```

### What it does

1. **Defines** how to scale numeric columns (`StandardScaler`) and encode categoricals (`OneHotEncoder`).
2. **Fits** this transformer on the **entire** dataset so it “knows” every category upfront.
3. **Wraps** `transform` in a `FunctionTransformer` so that downstream pipelines reuse this single fitted transformer (preventing “unknown-category” warnings).

### Why we look for it

* Ensures consistency: the same scaling/encoding applied during training, testing, and explainability.
* Prevents data leakage by not refitting separately on train vs. test.

---

## 🔀 4. Train/Test Split

### Code

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train_log, y_test_log = train_test_split(
    X, y_log, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
y_test_orig = np.expm1(y_test_log)
```

### What it does

* **Partitions** your data into 80% **training** and 20% **testing**, with a fixed seed for reproducibility.
* **Recovers** the original‐scale target (`y_test_orig`) by applying `expm1` so you can measure real‐€ errors later.

### Why we look for it

* **Simulates** real‐world deployment: the model trains on known data and is evaluated on unseen data.
* Documenting this shows how you guard against over‐fitting and measure true generalization.

---

## 🚀 5. Baseline Model on Log Target

### Code

```python
baseline = Pipeline([('pre', wrapped_pre), ('lr', LinearRegression())])
baseline.fit(X_train, y_train_log)
y_pred_log = baseline.predict(X_test)
```

### What it does

* **Chains** preprocessing + a plain `LinearRegression` into one pipeline.
* **Fits** on `y_log`, predicting log‐prices on the test fold.

### Why we look for it

* **Establishes** a simple benchmark: if your fancy models can’t beat this, something is wrong.
* Documenting it explains why **pipelines** simplify “fit” and “predict” calls.

---

## 📊 6. Baseline Metrics (Log & Original Scales)

### Code

```python
mse_log = mean_squared_error(y_test_log, y_pred_log)
print("RMSE (log):", np.sqrt(mse_log))
print("R²  (log):", r2_score(y_test_log, y_pred_log))

y_pred = np.expm1(y_pred_log)
print("RMSE (€):", np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test_orig, y_pred)))
print("R²  (€):", r2_score(y_test_orig, y_pred))
```

### What it does

* **Reports** RMSE & R² on the **log scale**, showing how well you model `log(price)`.
* **Back‐transforms** to the € scale and recomputes RMSE & R² so you know the **real‐money** error.

### Why we look for it

* **Log‐scale metrics** let you validate the transform helped stabilize errors.
* **Original‐scale metrics** are what stakeholders (e.g. scouts, analysts) actually care about: “we’re off by €X M on average.”

## 🤖 7. Advanced Models & Hyperparameter Search

### Code (excerpt)

```python
models = {
  'ridge': {...},
  'lasso': {...},
  'rf':    {...},
  'xgb':   {...}
}
for name, cfg in models.items():
    gs = GridSearchCV(
      Pipeline([('pre', wrapped_pre), ('model', cfg['model'])]),
      cfg['params'], cv=5, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error'
    )
    gs.fit(X_train, y_train_log)
    # back-transform + compute RMSE & R²
```

### What it does

* **Sets up** four different model families:

  * **Ridge** (L2‐regularized linear)
  * **Lasso** (L1‐regularized linear)
  * **Random Forest** (bagged decision trees)
  * **XGBoost** (gradient‐boosted trees)
* **Grid‐searches** each over sensible hyperparameter grids (α for regularization, tree depth & count, etc.)
* **Evaluates** them on the test set (back‐transforming predictions) to find the absolute best RMSE & R².

### Why we look for it

* **Regularization** often beats plain LinearRegression by controlling over‐fit.
* **Tree‐based** methods capture non‐linearities and interactions at the cost of more complexity.
* Documenting the parameter grids shows how you balance model complexity vs. generalization.

## 💾 8. Model Persistence

### Code

```python
os.makedirs(os.path.join(repo_root, 'models'), exist_ok=True)
joblib.dump(best_model, os.path.join(repo_root, 'models', 'best_model.pkl'))
```

### What it does

* **Creates** a `models/` folder if needed.
* **Serializes** the chosen best‐performer so you can load it later (e.g. in a web app or scoring script) without retraining.

### Why we look for it

* Ensures **reproducibility**: everyone uses the exact same weights & encodings.
* Documenting persistence explains the handoff between “training” and “production.”

## 🔑 9. Feature Importances

### Code

```python
imps = best_model.named_steps['model'].feature_importances_
names = full_pre.get_feature_names_out()
top10 = pd.DataFrame({'feature': names, 'importance': imps}).nlargest(10, 'importance')
print(top10)
```

### What it does

* **Extracts** tree‐based feature importances and pairs them with the transformer’s output names.
* **Prints** the top 10 drivers of your model’s decisions.

### Why we look for it

* **Interpretability**: tells you which inputs matter most (e.g. `max_price`, `agent`, `age`).
* Documenting it guides business users to focus on the right signals and suggests new features to engineer.

## 🔍 10. SHAP Explanations

### Code

```python
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(tree, data=X_train_enc)
shap_vals  = explainer.shap_values(X_test_enc, check_additivity=False)
shap.summary_plot(shap_vals, X_test_enc, feature_names=full_pre.get_feature_names_out())
```

### What it does

* **Builds** a SHAP explainer for your tree model, passing in the encoded training data.
* **Computes** SHAP values on the test set (disabling a strict additivity check to avoid numerical errors).
* **Plots** a summary showing, for each feature, how positive vs. negative values push predictions up or down.

### Why we look for it

* **Granular interpretability**: unlike global importances, SHAP shows how each feature **influenced each individual prediction**.
* Documenting it demonstrates best practice for transparent ML in business/academic projects.

## 📈 11. Interpreting the Performance Table

| Model                  | RMSE | R²    |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| **Baseline (Linear)**  | 10   | 0.436 |
| **Ridge**              | 6    | 0.803 |
| **Lasso**              | 6    | 0.817 |
| **Random Forest (RF)** | 6    | 0.826 |
| **XGBoost (XGB)**      | 4    | 0.908 |

* **RMSE**: “On average, we’re off by €X M.”

  * Lower is better; halving RMSE from 10 → 4 shows your final model is twice as precise as the baseline.
* **R²**: “We explain X% of the variation in player prices.”

  * R² = 0.908 means you capture over 90% of the predictable signal in the data.

### Why these outputs

* **Benchmarking**: you need both an **absolute error** metric (RMSE) and a **relative fit** metric (R²) to fully assess model quality.
* **Model selection**: you choose the model with the lowest RMSE (here, XGBoost) as your final predictor.

---

## 🔧 12. Hyperparameter Takeaways

* **Ridge α=10**: strong L2 penalty shrank coefficients, reducing variance.
* **Lasso α=0.1**: mild L1 penalty zeroed out only the weakest signals.
* **RF (n=100, depth=10)**: balanced the depth vs. number of trees to capture non-linearities without over-fitting.
* **XGB (η=0.1, depth=3, n=100)**: shallow, slow‐learning boosted trees generalized best.

### Why we examine these

* **Regularization strength** tells you how “complex” a linear model your data needs.
* **Tree depths & counts** reveal how intricate the non-linear patterns are.
