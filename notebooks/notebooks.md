# Notebooks

## Overview
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploration and prototyping.

## Contents
- `04_exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: outline what analyses are included (EDA plots, feature correlations, distributions).

## Guidelines

- Point to scripts in `src/` for reproducibility.

## Observations
- Key takeaways from EDA (missing data patterns, distribution of market values, correlation insights).
